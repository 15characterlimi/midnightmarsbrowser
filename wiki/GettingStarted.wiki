#summary Getting started with MMB 2.0

= Getting Started =

  * After downloading Midnight Mars Browser and running the program, you will be asked to select a workspace directory.  If you haven't already created a workspace directory, create an empty directory called "MidnightMarsBrowser" or "MMBWorkspace".  Do not choose the program directory.  Images, image indexes and metadata are stored in the MMB workspace directory.

  * The first thing you will need to do is run an Update.  Select “Get Latest Images from Exploratorium”. In addition to downloading the latest images, this should download the 2.0 image metadata.
 
  * Consult the Navigation menu for new commands and keyboard shortcuts.  Also hover over the icons on the toolbar to see what they do.
 
  * If you are familiar with Eclipse, MMB2.0 will probably make sense to you.  If not (and perhaps you're not), it might not be obvious how it works at first. There are control views and rover views, all within a single window. The control views reflect the status of the topmost rover view. When you make changes in a control view, like changing view settings or selecting a different images, the change is reflected in the rover view, and vice versa.  
 
  * One nice shortcut in Eclipse is to double-click a view's title tab to make the view fill the entire window. Double click the title tab again to return to normal size.
 
  * On a Mac, it is important to keep the MidnightMarsBrowser application in the same place as its support files and directories. This is not good Mac behavior, but it is how Eclipse works. I'm not sure quite how to get around that yet - it will take some work.
